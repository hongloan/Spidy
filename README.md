# Spidy

This is a demo code that runs on Spidy, the robot introduced
[here](http://www.thingiverse.com/make:129549).  This code is written for the
AVR on Arduino Micro and is licensed under GNU GPL version 2 or later.

The accompanying `Makefile` builds the code for the particular micro and with
the `install` target uploads it.
